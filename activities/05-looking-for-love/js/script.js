/**
A5: Looking for love
John Mendoza

Using functions to find love

Plan:
1. Set up the program
  Create objects representing our circles looking for love
  Do basic set up of our canvas
  Assign the circles random starting velocities in setup
  Set the background in draw
2. Work on the simulation part
  Get the circles moving and display them
  Check for either circle moving off the screen (sadness)
  Check for the circles intersecting (love)
  Move the simulation stuff into functions
3. Add the idea of states (title, simulation, love, sadness)
  Create a state variable and check it in draw
  Add title, love, and sadness functions that use simple text
  Connect the states (click to begin, simulation leads to outcomes)
